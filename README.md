Sales Visualization using Pandas & Matplotlib

Internship – Syntecxhub (Data Science)
Week 2 – Project 1: Time Series & Category Charts

This project focuses on visualizing supermarket sales data using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib.  
The goal is to show sales trends over time and compare sales across different business categories.

A line chart was used to visualize monthly sales because it clearly shows trends across time.  
A bar chart was chosen to compare sales for each product line, as bar charts work best for category comparisons.  
A pie chart represents the proportion of total sales contributed by each city.
